The New Tir Web Site
====================

The design is essentially the same one that I got for
[Mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org), but done with a different color scheme that I
think fits Tir better.  Same lua code is generating it as the other site,
and I may start trying to turn this into a generic blog platform as another
example of using Tir.

I'm going to be using Tir in a few new projects, and want to dust it off
and get a better site up for it.  Hopefully I'll have some examples from
real projects I've done like [Hype.la](http://hype.la) so people can 
base their own projects off it.

Stay tuned for more stuff.
