This is an example application that just shows how to use the Tir.Task
module.  Tir.Task lets you start a background task that is fed messages
using 0MQ.  The Task can be on remote machines, local, and configured
however you need using 0MQ.

To run this, do the following:

mkdir run tmp logs
m2sh -db conf/config.sqlite -config conf/mongrel2.conf
m2sh -db conf/config.sqlite start -every

Now in another window:

tir start

You should see the background task get started.  If you then 
in yet another window do this:

curl http://localhost:6767/Task

You'll see your request go through, you'll get an OK right back,
and then the background task will dump the request headers.

To see how this is done, look at the app/test_sender.lua and
app/test_task.lua files.
