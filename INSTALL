The Tir web framework is a simple micro framework written in
Lua that uses Mongrel2 for the heavy lifting.  If you're installing
this then you are using this at your own risk.


INSTALL

You need to have Lua 5.1, ZeroMQ, and LuaRocks installed.  Then do this:

make install

That should be it.  If you hit errors then let me know.
